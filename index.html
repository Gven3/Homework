      In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player
      combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of
      the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique
      abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become
      more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and
      purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In League's main mode,
      Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and
      destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.
